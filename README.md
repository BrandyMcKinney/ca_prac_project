flask_tutorial
This is not unique code, rather notations I've made throughout Flask's tutorial for building a web app. I am Learning Flask in preparation for building my first website using python.

Previous projects I built were made using Ruby and Ruby on Rails Framework and also using the Mac OS. There is a learning curve  in that  this tutorial will be in Python, using Flask and I will be using Windows OS (which is what my current employer uses).

In following the Flask tutorial (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/) I hope to achieve:
- proficiency in using PowerShell
- a strong understanding in building using Flask
- strengthen my python skills
- gain enough mastery to commence in building the actual project.
