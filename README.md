# ca_prac_project

I am Learning Flask (through a guided Flask tutorial) in preparation for building my current employer's company website.

Previous projects I built were made using Ruby and Ruby on Rails Framework and also using Mac OS. There is a learning curve  in that  this tutorial will be in Python, using Flask and also using Windows OS (which is what my current employer uses).

In following the Flask tutorial (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/) I hope to achieve:
- proficiency in using PowerShell
- a strong understanding in building using Flask
- strengthen my python skills
- gain enough mastery to commence in building the actual project being a simple but beautibul website for my current employer.
